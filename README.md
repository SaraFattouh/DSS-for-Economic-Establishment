In online advertising, click-through rate (CTR) is a very important metric for evaluating ad performance. As a result, click prediction systems are essential and widely used for sponsored search and real-time bidding.
In this project, we developed a prediction model for click-through rate in online advertising via classification and prediction algorithms to support decision making.
We used and compared a broad spectrum of techniques, including Neural Networks, Decision Trees, Linear Regression and SVM.
